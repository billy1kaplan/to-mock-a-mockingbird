"Does my wife lie and are you Teresa?"

Case:
Teresa, Wife => Yes
Teresa, not Wife => U
Lenore, Wife => No
Lenore, not Wife => ?

If the Lady answers Yes, Teresa is the name of his wife.

We cannot encode all 4 possiblities into a single answer!
(Yes or no can only encode information for two states; whereas we need information for 4).
