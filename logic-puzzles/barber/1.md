Consider the case where the town has these two barbers and no on else.

Cases:
R -> R
A -> A
Arturo must shave Roberto since Roberto does not shave Arturo. 

A -> R
R -> A
Arturo cannot shave Roberto because Roberto shaves him.

A -> R
A -> A
Roberto would have to shave Arturo since Arturo shaves him.

R -> R
R -> A
Roberto cannot shave Arturo since Arturo does not shave him.

There is a paradox.
