Consider the case where the town has these two barbers and no on else.

Cases:
R -> R
A -> A
Artero must shave Roberto to shave any inhabitant that shaves Roberto.

A -> R
R -> A
Roberto shaves Artero, not Roberto, so Artero cannot shave him.

A -> R
A -> A
This works. Arturo shaves Roberto so he can shave himself.

R -> R
R -> A
Roberto shaves Arturo, so he cannot shave himself.

No paradox.
